# Air-Ticket-Prices-Project
Project one for Data Science and Analytics Coding Bootcamp

For our first group project, my class was asked to choose their own topics of research and to find their own data sources. We chose to investigate the factors that influence the prices of plane tickets using ticket purchase history from the Travelpayouts Data API

Included in this repository are my contributions to the project (prices by direction and by weekday of departure).
